The StreamingSound (_stream) type is used to play any kind of music or sound that is played through the front-end gameplay. Streaming sounds are stereo sounds.

Fields:

Duration - integer value - The length of the sound in ms.
ChildSounds -  Item list of child sounds to stream.

Example:

"dlc_aw_track_1" plays all ChildSounds entries at the same time, using streaming information controlled by the game mood to fade in/out each stem. The category applied to each of the child stems affects how the game's StemMix and Mood entries control them.

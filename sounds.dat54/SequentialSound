The SequentialSound (_seq, _sq) type is similar in structure to the MultitrackSound. It is used to play one sound item immediately after another. 

The data contains a list of ChildSounds which refer to other sound entries. The type assumes that each subsequent sound is to be played immediately after the previous sound. 

Delay can be achived by using other entry types on the individual items rather than on the SequentialSound entry itself.

The maximum number of child sounds in a sequence is 32.

Fields:

ChildSounds - Item list of child sounds to play in sequence.

Example:

Below, "note_2" will play immediately after "note_1" when "notes" is played.

<Item type="SequentialSound">
 <Name>notes</Name>
 <Header>
  <Flags value="0x00000001" />
  <Flags2 value="0xAAA8AAAA" />
 </Header>
 <ChildSounds>
  <Item>note_1</Item>
  <Item>note_2</Item>
 </ChildSounds>
</Item>
